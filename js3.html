    <!-- What are promises and why do we need them? -->
A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. 
It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason.
1.	Improves Code Readability
2.	Better handling of asynchronous operations
3.	Better flow of control definition 

<!-- What is the purpose of async/await keywords? -->
An async function is a function declared with the async keyword, and the await keyword is
permitted within it. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior 
to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.

<!-- What is hoisting? -->
It is the default behaviour of moving all the declarations at the top of the scope before code execution.

<!-- What is the DOM? -->
The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content 
of a document on the web. 
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the
page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents 
the document as nodes and objects; that way programming languages can interact with the page.

<!-- Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN -->
Undefined - It is a global variable that JavaScript creates at run time. JavaScript assigns
undefined to any variable that has been declared but not initialized or defined. 
not defined - A not defined is a variable that is not declared at a given point of time with 
declaration keyword like var, let, or const.
NaN - It represents not a number this property indicates that a value is not legitimate number.

<!-- How many operators do we have in JS ? -->
 6 types of operators in JS they are :-
1.Arithmetic Operators
2.Comparison Operators
3.Logical Operators
4.Assignment Operators
5.Conditional Operators
6.Ternary Operator

<!-- What are pure functions? -->
Pure Function is a function (a block of code ) that always returns the same result if the same 
arguments are passed. It does not depend on any state, or data change during a programâ€™s execution rather it only depends on its input arguments.

<!-- What is callback hell -->
Callback Hell is an anti-pattern with multiple nested callbacks which makes code hard to read and debug when dealing with asynchronous logic. The callback hell looks like below,

ex - async1(function(){
    async2(function(){
        async3(function(){
            async4(function(){
                ....
            });
        });
    });
});

<!-- What is promise chaining -->

The process of executing a sequence of asynchronous tasks one after another using promises is known as Promise chaining. Let's take an example of promise chaining for calculating the final result,

ex- 
new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {

  setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);

}).then(function(result) {

  console.log(result);
  return result * 2;

}).then(function(result) {

  console.log(result); 
  return result * 3;

}).then(function(result) {

  console.log(result); 
  return result * 4;

});

<!-- What are arrow functions? -->
It allow you to create functions in a cleaner way camapred to regular function.
ex - hello = () => {
    return "Hello World!";
  }
  
<!-- Give an example of async/await   -->
async function f() {

    let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => resolve("done!"), 1000)
    });
  
    let result = await promise; // wait until the promise resolves (*)
  
    alert(result); // "done!"
  }
  
  f();
